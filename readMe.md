# 🔗 URL Shortener – Utils Module

This project is a simple mock URL shortener built with Node.js and Express.

My responsibility in this group project was to design and implement the **utility module** that handles:

- Short code generation
- File-based storage
- Reading & writing JSON
- Saving URL mappings
- Retrieving URLs

The utilities are reusable and keep the server/routes clean and modular.
